      "body1": "South Cotabato: The Seven Falls of Lake Sebu\n\nMindanao, the second biggest island of the Philippines, harbors some of the grandest waterfalls in the country. More than Maria Cristina and Tinago of Iligan, Tinuy-an of Bislig, or Asik-Asik of Cotabato, there are more scattered on its vast forest land including Seven Falls of Lake Sebu.\n\nSituated in highland town of South Cotabato, the Seven Falls is an amazing natural wonder in Barangay Lake Siloton of the municipality of Lake Sebu. It consists of seven waterfalls with strong water coming from the outflows of Lake Sebu, an important watershed in the region. The outflows goes to Lonon River and catches by the smaller Lake Siloton before cascading from Hikong Alo (first waterfalls) to Hikong Tonok (seventh waterfalls) and finally to Allah River.\n\nThe first two waterfalls are the easily accessible among the seven – Waterfalls One or “Hikong Alo” is standing at 35 feet while Waterfalls Two or “Hikong Bente” is 70 feet tall. Getting up close to the other five (Hikong B’Lebel, Hikong Lowig, Hikong Ukol, Hikong K’Fo-I and Hikong Tonok) is quite an effort but they can be easily seen by riding the zipline that starts at Waterfalls One.",

Among them are School of Living Traditions, Punta Isla Resort, Lemobung Lodge and Restaurant, Balben Family Cove, Estares Resort, Merl Garden Spring Resort, Tonez Farm Resort and Artacho Resort.",
      "aminitiesNames": "Amenities\n\nOne of the tallest in Asia, the Seven Falls Zipline runs at 180 meters above ground (around 300 meters above sea level). It is divided into two lines: the first extends 740 meters, and the other 420. Visitors dangle and are swooshed 20 meters per second as they scramble to feast their eyes with the gorgeous view, take photographs, and just enjoy the moment. If you could do just one zipline in the Philippines, this is most definitely it.",

      "body1": "The place got its name from a very interesting piece of the town’s culture – the dreamweavers. In fact, Lake Sebu is known as the Land of Dreamweavers.\n\nLegend has it that a goddess named Fu Dalu taught the Tboli to weave t’nalak through dreams. Generations of Tboli women (now known as dreamweavers) learned the skill, basing tribal designs and cloth patterns on what they dreamt.\n\nLake Sebu in South Cotabato might just be the wonderland we have always dreamed of.\n\nName it – amazing natural tourist destinations, friendly and accommodating people, colorful tradition and culture – Lake Sebu has gotten all that it takes to stand out and captivate travelers’ hearts like yours. Contrary to the peace and order situation that has been reported all over the news, South Cotabato is generally peaceful and tourists will never have any reason to hold back from discovering its hidden beautiful places.\n\nDreamweavers Hill offers you a relaxing and peaceful retreat in the elevated parts of Lake Sebu. It gives you a memorable experience of the rich T’boli culture while you bask yourself in the wonders of nature and agricultural products surrounding the place.\n\nSure enough, the comforts we get from high-end condominiums and hotels are of 5-star ratings, but the kind of accommodation we get from traditional T’boli houses that are offered here are more than just the ratings. It’s more on immersing ourselves into their rich way of life.\n\nThe accommodation types here are mostly made of bamboos and there are some that can cater up to 15 persons. You will love the breeze of the cold air here. And with a perfect timing, you can even experience the fog blanketing the place.\n\nYou won’t also run out picture-perfect spots as the place is tucked in an area where there’s lush vegetation and gorgeous blooms of flowers. They also have spots, hammocks, and even traditional houses that are intended for picture taking.",

The “Mukbang Gulay Challenge” offered here is just one of the many things that make this place a standout. It’s not just a new way to elevate the challenge (especially for those who are not fond of eating vegetables), but it’s also a healthier one.\n\nThey also allow their guests to pick/harvest the vegetables of their choice and pay for them – another one of a kind experience. Dreamweavers Hill has also its own restaurant serving delicious local dishes.\n\nsource:https://vismin.ph/2021/dreamweavers-hill-lake-sebu/",
